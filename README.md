Many organizations deploying computer networks are susceptible to different kinds of attacks in the current era.
These attacks compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of network systems. It is a big challenge
to build a relia-ble network as several new attacks are being introduced by the attackers. The aim of this paper
is to improve the performance of the various machine learning algo-rithms such as KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,
Bagging Meta Estimator and XGBoost by utilizing feature importance technique.

These classifiers are chosen as they perform superior to other base and ensemble machine learning techniques after
feature selection. Feature Importance technique is utilized to ob-tain the highest ranked features. Reduced attributes
improve the accuracy as well as decrease the computation time and prediction time. The experimental results on 
UNSW-NB dataset show that there is a drastic decrease in the computation time with reduced attributes compared to 
evaluating the model using the dataset with the entire set of attributes.

Keywords: Accuracy, Attributes, Feature selection, Machine learning, Computa-tion time
